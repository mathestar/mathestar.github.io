Mathematics is rich with open problems that have fascinated generations of mathematicians. Here, we take a look at some of the most famous unsolved problems.

## Goldbach's Conjecture

Goldbach's Conjecture states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. While numerous examples of this property have been found, the conjecture remains without a complete proof.

## Riemann's Hypothesis

Riemann's Hypothesis is one of the deepest and most complex problems in number theory. It pertains to the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann Zeta function and has profound implications for prime number distribution. Despite intensive research, the hypothesis remains unresolved.

## Collatz Conjecture

The Collatz Conjecture, also known as the 3n + 1 conjecture, posits that for any positive integer, iteratively applying a specific function will eventually lead to the number 1. Despite testing the conjecture for numerous numbers, it remains without proof.

## P vs. NP Problem

The P vs. NP problem is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems and addresses a fundamental question in computer science: Are there problems that are easily verifiable (in P) but hard to solve (not in P)? Resolving this problem would have far-reaching implications for computational theory.

## Unsolvability of the Quintic Equation

The unsolvability of the quintic equation pertains to the quest for a general formula to solve fifth-degree equations. Already in the 19th century, it was proven that there is no general algebraic solution for such equations.

## Summary

Famous unsolved problems in mathematics like Goldbach's Conjecture, Riemann's Hypothesis, and others captivate mathematicians worldwide. These challenges represent deep questions about numbers, structures, and computation, showcasing the immense complexity and fascination of mathematics.
