It may sound complicated, but don’t worry, we’ll explain it in a very simple way! The Decimal System - Numbers We Know First, let’s take a look at the decimal system that we use in our everyday life. It consists of the numbers from 0 to 9. When we write a number, such as 123, each digit has a specific value depending on its position. The first digit from the right is the one’s place, the second is the ten’s place, the third is the hundred’s place, and so on. The Binary Number System - A World of Zeros and Ones In the binary number system, we only have two numbers: 0 and 1. That may sound limited, but it’s incredibly powerful! In the binary world, we have no ten’s place or hundred’s place, only the one’s place and the two’s place. Bits and Bytes - The Building Blocks of Data In the world of computers, the smallest building blocks for data are called “bits.” A bit can be either 0 or 1. Multiple bits are grouped together to form “bytes.” A byte consists of 8 bits. With bytes, we can store and process letters, numbers, and other information. ASCII and Unicode - Encoding of Characters Computers store texts and characters as numbers. In the past, we used ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). It was a character encoding that assigned a unique number to each character (letters, numbers, special symbols). This allowed a computer to convert and store characters into binary numbers. However, ASCII had a limitation: it could only represent a limited set of characters, such as the letters of the English alphabet and some special symbols. To address this limitation, Unicode was developed! Unicode is like a huge lexicon containing characters from many different languages and scripts. It can represent thousands of characters, including letters from almost all languages in the world, mathematical symbols, emojis, and much more! ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange Let’s talk about character encoding, how we store characters and letters in computers. In the past, when computers were still quite young, there was ASCII, which stood for ‘American Standard Code for Information Interchange.’ It was like a kind of magic book for computers, assigning a specific number to each character. ASCII used 7 bits to represent 128 characters. These characters included letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, punctuation marks, and some special symbols. So, for example, if we had the letter ‘A,’ it was represented as 01000001. The ‘a’ was 01100001, and the number ‘5’ was 00110101. It was quite straightforward. But here’s the problem: ASCII could only represent a limited number of characters, and it was limited to English and some special symbols. This meant it couldn’t represent other languages and symbols. For example, if you wanted to write texts in other languages or with special characters, you couldn’t do that very well with ASCII. Unicode - The Global Character Encoding But then came Unicode! Unicode is like a huge, magical book containing many, many different characters from many different languages and scripts. And you know how many characters Unicode can represent? Over a million! It’s truly like a magic trick that allows representing letters, numbers, symbols, emojis, and just about anything else you can imagine! With Unicode, we can now write texts in almost any language and use many other cool symbols. There are special characters for mathematics, currencies, arrows, and much more. It’s truly fantastic! Conversion from Decimal to Binary Now, let’s learn how to convert a decimal number into a binary number. It’s not that difficult! We take the decimal number and repeatedly divide it by 2. We keep track of the remainders. Then, we write the remainders from bottom to top. Let’s convert the number 13 into binary. 13 ÷ 2 = 6. Remainder = 1 6 ÷ 2 = 3, Remainder = 0 3 ÷ 2 = 1, Remainder = 1 1 ÷ 2 = 0, Remainder = 1 Now, we write the remainders from bottom to top: 1101. That’s it! The binary representation of 13 is 1101. Conversion from Binary to Decimal Now, let’s find out how to convert a binary number into a decimal number. That’s not difficult either! We take each binary place from right to left and multiply it by the corresponding power of 2. Let’s convert the binary number 1101 into decimal. 1 * 2^0 = 1 0 * 2^1 = 0 1 * 2^2 = 4 1 * 2^3 = 8 Now, we add up these results: 1 + 0 + 4 + 8 = 13. That’s it! The decimal representation of the binary number 1101 is 13. The binary number system allows us to store and process data in computers in a straightforward way. With the knowledge of converting from binary to decimal, we can better understand the fascinating world of zeros and ones!" },{ "title" : "Euclid - The Father of Geometry" ,"category" : "["computer science", "number system"]" ,"tags" : "binary, decimal, number system, conversion, bits, bytes, ascii, unicode" ,"url" : "/jekyll-theme-yat/en/2023-07-28-euclid" ,"date" : "Jul 28, 2023" ,"content" : "Euclid, also known as Euclid of Alexandria, was an ancient Greek mathematician who lived in the 3rd century BC.

It helps us calculate the length of one side of a right-angled triangle when we know the lengths of the other two sides. What is a Right-Angled Triangle? A right-angled triangle is a triangle that has a 90-degree angle, often marked with a small square. The Pythagorean Theorem Imagine you have a magical triangle. This triangle has a very special property. When you know the length of one side, you can calculate the length of another side. Let’s see how it works! The magical triangle has three sides: a long side, a medium side, and a short side. The long side is like the king, and we call it the hypotenuse. The other two sides are the subjects, and we call them legs. The Pythagorean Theorem tells us that the square of the length of the long side (hypotenuse) is equal to the sum of the squares of the two short sides (legs). Sounds complicated, right? Let’s make it simpler! Imagine you have a big square that is as big as the long side of the triangle. Then you have two smaller squares that are as big as the short sides of the triangle. When you add up the areas of the two smaller squares, it is exactly equal to the area of the big square. That’s the Pythagorean Theorem in action! The Pythagorean Theorem is: Here, “a” and “b” represent the lengths of the two legs of the right-angled triangle, while “c” is the length of the hypotenuse - the side opposite the right angle. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem To apply the Pythagorean Theorem, follow these simple steps: Identify the sides of the triangle: “a”, “b”, and “c”. Substitute the values into the theorem: Square the length of “a” and the length of “b”, add the squares, and you get the square of the length of “c”. Calculate the length of the hypotenuse “c”: Take the square root of the sum from Step 2. Example Suppose you have a right-angled triangle with side lengths: a = 3 cm b = 4 cm Step 1: Step 2: So, the length of the hypotenuse “c” is 5 cm. Calculating “a” or “b” Sometimes, we know the length of the hypotenuse “c” and one of the legs, such as “a”. To calculate the length of the other leg “b”, you can rearrange the Pythagorean Theorem: Then, take the square root of “b²” to find the length of “b”. Example Suppose you have a right-angled triangle with side lengths: c = 5 cm a = 3 cm To find “b”: So, the length of the leg “b” is 4 cm. Why is the Pythagorean Theorem Important? The Pythagorean Theorem is not only significant in Geometry but also has numerous applications in various fields such as architecture, engineering, and physics. It enables us to calculate side lengths of right-angled triangles and solve complex problems. Conclusion The Pythagorean Theorem is a powerful tool to help us calculate the side lengths of right-angled triangles. Through its application, we can solve a variety of interesting problems and explore the fascinating world of geometric relationships.

The side opposite this angle is called the opposite side (co), the side adjacent to it is called the adjacent side (ca), and the longest side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse (H). Sine (sin) The sine of an angle in a right-angled triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side (co) to the length of the hypotenuse (H). To calculate the sine of an angle, we simply divide the length of the opposite side (co) by the length of the hypotenuse (H). The sine tells us how large the angle is in relation to the hypotenuse (H). A large sine value indicates a steep angle, while a small sine value indicates a shallow angle. Cosine (cos) The cosine of an angle in a right-angled triangle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side (ca) to the length of the hypotenuse (H). To calculate the cosine of an angle, we divide the length of the adjacent side (ca) by the length of the hypotenuse (H). The cosine tells us how large the angle is in relation to the hypotenuse (H), but from a different perspective than the sine. If the sine is large, the cosine is small, and vice versa. This means that if one angle is steep, the other angle is shallow. Tangent (tan) The tangent of an angle in a right-angled triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side (co) to the length of the adjacent side (ca). The tangent shows us how large the angle is in relation to the adjacent side (ca). A large tangent value indicates a steep angle in relation to the adjacent side (ca), while a small tangent value indicates a shallow angle in relation to the adjacent side (ca). These simple ratios (Sine, Cosine, and Tangent) help us understand the relationship between the side lengths and angles in a right-angled triangle and find many practical applications in mathematics, science, and technology. Try it out yourself and explore the fascinating world of Trigonometry! Non-Right-Angled Triangles For non-right-angled triangles, we can use the Law of Cosines and the Law of Sines to calculate side lengths and angles. Law of Cosines The Law of Cosines states that the square of one side of a triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides minus twice the product of these sides and the cosine of the opposite angle. The Law of Cosines allows us to calculate the lengths of the sides of a non-right-angled triangle when we know the sizes of the angles and the lengths of the other sides. Law of Sines The Law of Sines states that the ratio of the length of one side to the sine of the opposite angle in a triangle is constant. Using the Law of Sines, we can calculate the lengths of the sides or the sizes of the angles in a non-right-angled triangle when we know the length of one side and the opposite angle. Example: Triangle Calculations We are dealing with a triangle with the following given values: Angle A = 110°25’36” Side b = 92 m Side c = 24 m Our objective is to calculate the missing values: Angle B, Angle C, and Side a. Step 1: Calculation of Side a We can calculate the lengths of the sides using the Law of Cosines: As a result: Step 2: Calculation of Angle B We start with the equation: To isolate Angle B, we can multiply both sides by b: To isolate Angle B, we apply the inverse sine function (Arcsine or sin⁻¹) to both sides: Since the inverse sine function cancels itself out, we get: Now, with the derived formula, we can use it to calculate Angle B: Step 3: Calculation of Angle C Given that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°, we can calculate Angle C: Trigonometry opens up a fascinating world of calculations and geometric relationships that find applications in many areas.
